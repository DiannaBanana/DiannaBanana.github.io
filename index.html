						Hi! I'm <strong>Dianna</strong>, a Fourth Year Computer Science student at the
						University of Victoria. I'm set to graduate in April 2022 <br />
					</h1>
					<br />
					<p>
						Currently, I am working as an Embedded Systems Engineering Intern at
						<a href="https://auroraim.ca"><span class="label">Aurora Industrial Machines</span></a>, 
						developing internal tools and systems for their IoT Infrastructure and control systems. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time, I like to go hiking or to the beach, play soccer with friends,
						game a little üòâ and listen to music. I also started playing with Unity recently!

							<h3>Day-Trading Distrbuted System</h3>
							<p>
							My team and I were contracted by DayTrading Inc. (a secret organization) to develop a prototype end-to-end solution to support their day trading clients and services.
							</p>   
							<br/>
							<p>
							Currently, my team and I are designing and implementing an online day-trading website to demonstrate software scalability techniques for up to 1500 concurrent users. 
							The distributed backend is powered by Python, Docker Swarm, Redis, Django, Gunicorn and Nginx. 
							We are using the Django REST Framework to develop the API and Djongo Engine to map SQL queries into a NoSQL MongoDB sharded cluster.

							<h3>Whale Watchers</h3>
							<p>
							Whales are beautiful and mysterious creatures and they frequently travel thousands of kilometers, making it difficult for scientists, researchers, and obesrvers to monitor the health and sightings of whales.
							</p>
							</br>
							<p>              
							In order to combat this challenge, we developed a CRUD web application and API hosted on Heroku to support whale observations using the Play Framework, JUnit, HTML and CSS.
							</p>
							</br>
							<p>  
							Check out our  <a href="https://whale-watcher-330.herokuapp.com/"><span class="label">Whale Watchers website!</span></a>

							<h3>Music to Image Generation</h3>
							<p>
							The visual aspects of listening to music have become an increasingly vital part of how we consume the medium. We do not simply ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to music anymore, we also ‚Äúwatch‚Äù it.
							Image generation is trying to address this area of ‚Äúwatching‚Äù music. Based off features of music, related images can be provided to any track someone listens to.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>
							My team and I seeked to research and expand this work on Image Generation and developed a Python program that automatically generates images from music data. 
							We used STFT, DCGAN, CNN, and LSTM as a neural network pipeline to learn correlations between genres of music and categorical images. 
							We also leveraged pre-processing techniques such as MFCC's and dimensionality reduction algorithms such as tSNE to correctly train models.
							</p>         
							<br/>   
							<p>
							We learned a lot during the journey of this project!
